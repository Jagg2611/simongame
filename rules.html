      <h1>SIMon Game Rules</h1>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        The objective of SIMon is to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds in
        the correct order. The sequence starts with one color and increases by
        one additional color each round. The game continues until the player
        makes a mistake or decides to stop.
      </p>
      <h2>Game Setup</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Power On:</strong> Start the game by powering on the SIMon
          device or pressing the "Start" button on the web version.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Initial Sequence:</strong> The game will display the first
          color and play the corresponding sound.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Watch and Listen:</strong> Pay attention to the sequence of
          colors and sounds presented by SIMon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repeat the Sequence:</strong> After the sequence is displayed,
          use the buttons or color pads to repeat the sequence in the same
          order.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Next Round:</strong> If you successfully replicate the
          sequence, SIMon will add one more color to the sequence and play the
          new, longer sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Continue Playing:</strong> Repeat the new, longer sequence.
          The game gets progressively harder as the sequence length increases.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Endless Mode:</strong> There is no definitive end to the game;
          it continues until the player makes a mistake.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set Number of Rounds:</strong> In some versions, the game
          might have a predetermined number of rounds. Successfully completing
          all rounds means you win the game.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Losing the Game</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Incorrect Sequence:</strong> If you press the wrong color or
          press the colors in the wrong order, the game will end, and you will
          have to start over from the beginning.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Time Limit:</strong> Some versions of SIMon might have a time
          limit for each move. If you take too long to repeat the sequence, the
          game might end.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Levels:</strong> There could be different levels with
          increasing difficulty, such as faster sequences or more complex color
          combinations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> Concentrate on the sequence without
          distractions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Practice:</strong> The more you play, the better you'll get at
          remembering longer sequences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Patterns:</strong> Try to recognize patterns in the sequences
          to make them easier to remember.
        </li>
